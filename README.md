# Web Vulnerability Scanner (lab-only)

Simple Python-based scanner that:
- crawls page forms
- injects safe test payloads (XSS/SQLi strings)
- reports findings to JSON

**Run from GitHub Actions** via the `Manual Scan` workflow (Actions → Manual Scan → Run workflow).

**DO NOT** use on real production sites without permission. See SAFE_USAGE.md.
